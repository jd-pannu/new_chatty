# new_chatty

Created an AI based learning model using neural networks to provide responses for the user. This AI chatbot can respond to the user for any question about a dataset that it was trained on. Using Python as the main coding language to create the chatbot and using libraries such as chatterbot to help train the model. Finally, using the Flask library and some light HTML and CSS I was able to display the responses from chatbot in a good-looking manner.
